Pain Points
## Keeping Track of Job Applications is difficult
People applying for jobs in the current market may have to apply to dozens or hundreds of jobs before landing a position. When dealing with this large of a volume of job applications, it can be difficult to keep track of all the jobs you’ve applied to, whether it’s to stay on a schedule of sending a particular number of applications a week/month, or just knowing when the application was sent to accurately gauge when to follow up.


## Common organizational methods can be time-consuming
By far, the first result that appears when doing a web search for “How do I keep track of my job applications?’ is using a spreadsheet. Sure, that might be a widespread solution, but it still requires a good deal of setup.
